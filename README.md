# entypo-plus

A bowerified version of the entypo plus icon pack.

# Installation

```bower install entypoplus```

# What's in here?

This icon pack distribution contains font files which can be used to generate
glyphs. For a demonstration see demo.html. This icon pack was generated by
the [Icomoon App](https://icomoon.io/#app-features).

# Why did you do this?

There were no official entypo plus packages that were tagged so I created this
repository to register with bower to help myself (and anyone else) that needed
this icon pack and didn't want to package the source with their application.
